This is supposed to be a simple tool for getting the chinese sign from a year.

it uses a simple script with TKinter and it should run by only having python 3 installed

This was inspired by the GG33 family.

If i get to it, it should ideally differentiate dates between lunar calendar and gregorian calendar. moreover i could do elements and yin and yang
